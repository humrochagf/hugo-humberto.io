Hello, my name is **Humberto**.

I'm a **Computer Scientist** / **Open Source** enthusiast specialized on problem solving currently living in **Quebec, Canada**.

Despite working with a wide range of technologies, my favorite tools are the **commandline**, the **VIM** editor, and my OS of choice is **Linux**.

Other than writing in this blog, my hobbies are diverse. Starting at gastronomy and pastry passing through pixel art, video games, kung fu, emoji, memes, and spoil my cats, finishing by learning new languages (programming languages or not ðŸ˜œ).

This blog is the place were I put into words a portion of my knowledge, synthesizing my personal discovery's and learning's but with no ambition of being the absolute source of truth to anything. I hope you find here something that can help you as it helped me before ðŸ˜Š

You can also find me at [github](https://github.com/humrochagf), [twitter](https://twitter.com/humrochagf) or [telegram](https://t.me/humrochagf).

And always remember: **Be kind**, **People > Technology** and **stay hydrated**!
